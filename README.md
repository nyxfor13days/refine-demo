# What is [Refine](https://refine.dev/)?

Refine is a headless library built on React to create CRUD applications. It provides us with a set of hooks, providers and components which we can use in our app to eliminate the problem of repetitive tasks.

## âœ… Why use Refine?

Refine provides APIs which provides ready-made integrations with Material UI, Ant Design, Chakra UI and Mantine. Refine provides the following benefits:

- [x] Easy to manage Admin Panels, Stores, Dashboards and Forms.
- [x] Since it is a library, we can integrate it with other libraries.
- [x] It provides SSR support which makes it easier to work with Next Framework.
- [x] Allows you to manage states and implement mutations.

> Refine is working on adding support for React Native and can be useful for mobile apps. 

### Refine's Core API

Refine's core api provides hooks, providers and components which can be used to add custom components using TailwindCSS. The hooks and providers have no relation with the UI components which allows us to create our own data flow and components.

## ðŸ”´ Why not to use Refine?

Following are some of the reasons why refine won't be a good option for our current projects:

- Increases the load time of the web app.
- Takes a lot of code refactoring for current projects to implement refine.
- **Making refine work with Ionic will take a lot of time and changing existing components.**
- Need to change the way backend sends data to the frontend to have it work with data providers by Refine.

## When can we use Refine?

Our current projects will take a lot of modifications to implement refine but starting a new project we can implement refine but requires time because we need to create new components. Refine can be useful to create projects which require admin panels or blogs.
